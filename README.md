## TL;DR

I spent 10 years running a marketing agency starting at the bottom and quickly rising within the first 6 months to director of operations. I brought great success through software engineering, marketing, closing new business, managing teams and producing results.

I spent another 10 years building and growing businesses small and large through hard work and careful planning including some of my own.

I am active in tech communities and have spoken at both digital summit and internet summit.

## Executive Summary:

Operations, technology, and marketing leader with **20+ years of experience** scaling businesses across hospitality, technology, and professional services. **While at White Fox I grew accounts from stagnant at 30 to booming at 350 with a 98% customer retention rate**. **Onboarded 60,000 users at Realay.com** At Hurley's Creekside Dining & Rhum Bar, **grew annual revenue from $1.3M to $5.4M** through brand development, marketing strategy, and operational excellence.
